    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A taco is a traditional Mexican food that consists of a small tortilla that is folded around a filling and eaten by hand. The tortilla can be hard or soft, and is typically made from corn or wheat. The filling can include meat, cheese, vegetables, refried beans, and salsa. 
    </p>
    <p>Tacos can be served hot or cold. Some common toppings include lettuce, diced tomatoes, and shredded cheese. Traditional Mexican tacos, also known as street tacos, are typically served on corn tortillas and include onions, cilantro, and salsa as toppings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Quick-pickled onions</li>
        <li>Creamy avocado dip</li>
        <li>Easy refried beans</li>
        <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Salsa verde</li>
        <li>Shredded green cabbage</li>
        <li>feta cheese</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Lime wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the onions, avocado dip, and beans as directed, in that order.</li>
        <li><p>Once they are ready, warm the tortillas in a large skillet over medium heat in batches, flipping to warm each side. Alternatively, you can warm them directly over a low flame on a gas range. Stack the warmed tortillas on a plate and cover with a tea towel to keep warm</p></li>
        <li><p>To assemble the tacos, spread refried beans down the center of each tortilla. Top with avocado dip and onions (for reference, I used all of the beans and about half of the avocado dip and onions). Finish the tacos with garnishes of your choice, and serve immediately.</p></li>
        <li><p>Leftover components are best served separately; reheat the tortillas and beans before serving. Leftover pickled onions and avocado dip are great on quesadillas, nachos or tortilla chips, sandwiches, etc.</p></li>
